# 📊 Sales Insights and Reporting using SQL | Customer and Product Analysis

Welcome to the **Sales Data Analysis** project!
In this project, I performed an end-to-end analysis of sales data to uncover key insights about customer behaviour, product performance, and overall business trends.

## 🧩 Dataset Overview

The dataset consists of three relational tables:

* **dim\_customers**: Contains customer attributes and identifiers.
* **dim\_products**: Contains product details, including category and pricing information.
* **fact\_sales**: Contains transactional sales data, linking customers and products over time.

## 📈 Project Highlights

* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  Conducted initial exploration to understand the data structure, identify anomalies, and prepare for deeper analysis.

* **Advanced Data Analysis**:

  * Analysed category-level sales performance and identified top-performing product categories.
  * Tracked revenue growth trends on a monthly and yearly basis.
  * Performed customer segmentation based on spending behaviour.
  * Identified the top 10 customers contributing the highest revenue.
  * Detected high-value customers based on lifetime value thresholds.

* **Insightful Reporting**:

  * Created a **Customer Report** summarising purchase frequency, total spend, and customer value categorisation.
  * Generated a **Product Report** highlighting best-selling products, revenue contribution by products, and category-wise revenue distribution.

Would you also like me to create a short **2-line "Project Summary"** you can paste on your **resume**? (Hiring managers love it when you connect project outcomes with business impact.)
Should I give that too? 🚀
